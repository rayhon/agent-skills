      <h3>Can AI Infrastructure Work Like Magic?</h3>
      <p><strong>Erik Bernhardsson, CEO of Modal</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>From Spotify to GPU Cloud</strong>: Erik shares how building Spotify's recommendation engine (and the <code>Luigi</code> orchestrator) led him to realize that infra is usually the bottleneck for AI teams, not the code.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Killer Use Case"</strong>: He details how the explosion of **Stable Diffusion** served as Modal’s breakthrough moment, proving that bursty, GPU-heavy inference is the primary pain point for modern startups.</li>
        <li><strong>Elasticity vs. Clusters</strong>: Why the shift from management-heavy clusters to "scaling in seconds" is the only sustainable path for batch processing and model execution in the AI era.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Maximalism</strong>: Erik explains his philosophy of running user code in a deeply integrated, multi-tenant cloud environment to achieve the "Magic" developer experience.</li>
